### How do I build or execute code I've written in Atom?

Atom doesn't have built-in support for building any type of code nor does it have built-in support for executing any kind of code other than JavaScript. Atom has a JavaScript interactive command-line (also known as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) available through the Developer Tools. You can access the JavaScript REPL by using the following steps:

1. Launch Atom
1. Select the menu `View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools`
1. Click the "Console" tab

If you're looking for a JavaScript execution environment beyond a REPL, Atom doesn't come with anything built-in for that purpose.

If you want to build code or execute scripts from within Atom there are a number of packages available including:

* [build](https://atom.io/packages/build)
* [script](https://atom.io/packages/script)

### How do I accept input from my program or script when using the script package?

The [script package](https://atom.io/packages/script) doesn't support accepting input from the user in the scripts it runs. The option with the best chance of success is to run the script or program from the terminal that comes with your operating system. If that isn't something you want to do, you could try one of the many [terminal packages](https://atom.io/packages/search?q=terminal) that are available.

See [rgbkrk/atom-script#743](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script/issues/743) for details.

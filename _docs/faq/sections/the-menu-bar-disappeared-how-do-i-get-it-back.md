### The menu bar disappeared, how do I get it back?

If you're running Windows or Linux and you don't see the menu bar, it may have been accidentally toggled it off.  You can bring it back from the Command Palette with `Window: Toggle Menu Bar` or by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>.

You can disable hiding the menu bar with <kbd>Alt</kbd> by unchecking `Settings > Core > Auto Hide Menu Bar`.

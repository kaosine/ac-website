# Title

You ***MUST*** name your post as follows:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`

Replace the YEAR-MONTH-DAY with the date published and add your own title. This naming scheme is how jekyll renders and organizes our content.

## Suggestions

Make a copy of this file in `_drafts` and put your content there until you're ready to post.


## TODO

This naming scheme may change or add specific tags/categories in the frontmatter at some point. We'll update this when that decision is made.

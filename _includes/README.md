# About the includes section
- This only contains reused parts for the layout and to better seperate content out.

Title | Purpose
---|---
head.html | includes everything from the top of the page
header.html | the top part of the page
nav.html | the top navigation pulls from _data/nav.yml
footer.html | the bottom of the page
sidebar.html | the sidebar used more frequently in the docs section of the website


These need to be fleshed out and updated here instead of hardcoding them
